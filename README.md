Hey everyone, here we go with #HTML Form with PHP Integration

This project demonstrates a simple HTML form integrated with PHP for handling form submissions.

CLONE the repository ......

step 1:
Download XAMPP (or any other server)
download it successfully 
Then, OPEN the XAMPP file location, and click on the folder called “XAMPP htdocs folder”. This is where you will eventually be putting your code folder with your PHP code and other code files for your site.
Move your folder ( form project php ) ---->>> XAMPP htdocs folder.


Step 2:
Download and Install the Test Mail Server Tool
start at port 25
  
Step 3: Connect a MySQL Database to PHP
open my localhost/phpmyadmin/
Create Database: Click the New button to create a new database. ( DB NAME - phpprojectdatabase)
click the save button.
Then, insert some code files into phpprojectdatabase (that has been uploaded in the folder)
THIS WILL CONNECT SQL DATABASE TO PHP
ALS0, move this folder (phpprojectdatabse ) ---->>> XAMPP htdocs folder. (!important step)
  
step 4: Run the application
start xampp (apache server along with my SQL)
start mail server
go to the browser and paste localhost/foldername(form project php)/index.html 

You can see the notification too and also data will be saved at phpmyadmin --> phpprojectdatabase( DB name).
